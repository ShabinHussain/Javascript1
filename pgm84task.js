 // 1) Use map to create an array of strings containing both the type and value of each element.
  
//  2) Use filter to get all arrays where the number of strings is greater than the number of numbers
  
  // 3) Use reduce to concatenate all strings in the nested arrays into a single sentence.
  
  
 // 4) Use arrayFrom to create an array of unique strings from the nested arrays.
  
//  5) Use sort to sort the nested arrays based on the length of strings in each array.
  
  
 //  6) Use map to convert each string in the nested arrays to its uppercase form.
  
  
 //  7) Use filter to get all arrays where the sum of numbers is greater than 20.
  
  
//  8) Use reduceRight to concatenate and flatten all nested arrays in reverse order.
  
  
//  9) Use arrayFrom to create an array of the lengths of all strings in the nested arrays.
  
 //  10) Use includes to check if the word 'apple' is present in any of the nested arrays.
